Assignment 5 - myNotesApp

In this assignment, i have made a notes app, that lets users add/delete/notes. The notes will stay forever in the app (shared preferences). Made use of listview for scrollable list. Notes can be edited in a edittext.

Following is the summary of the app development:

Day 1: Basic UI implemented.

Day 2: Worked on the structure of app, designed the first activity of the app and added splashscreen.

Day 3: Sending the notes data via an id to another activity. Also worked on the saving of the notes. (note is no more getting deleted on pressing back button).

Day 4: Worked on the deletion of the note UI. (using alertbox).

Day 5: Create new notes logic, was stuck here due to blank note at the top of the listview. Added the ability to delete notes on long press. On long press, the app shows an alert screen for confirmation.

Day 6: Tried implementing checkboxes instead of alert dialog box, was not able to do it. (reverted back to alert dialog box).

Day 7: Added permanent storage via shared preferences such that the app doesnt delete the saved notes once app is closed and/or restarted. Worked on the UI.
